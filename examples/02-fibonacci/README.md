# Fibonacci

This example implements a function to calculate the fibonacci sequence.

## `fibonacci:load`
This is the entrypoint of the program, called when a player runs `/reload`. It calls the function to calculate the fibonacci sequence, then prints it out.

## `fibonacci:fibonacci`
This function contains the calculations for the fibonacci sequence. It loops from `0` to `$n`, and appends each result to the return array.
